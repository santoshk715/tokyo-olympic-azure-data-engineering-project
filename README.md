# Project Summary

The Tokyo Olympic Data Engineering Project leverages various Azure services to collect, process, and analyze data related to the Tokyo Olympic Games. The key components of the project include Azure Data Factory for ETL processes, Azure Databricks for data processing and transformation, and Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing and advanced analytics.


# Data Sources
Data Repository: Olympic Data on GitHub
Data Ingestion Code: Data Ingestion Pipeline on GitHub
Key Azure Services Used
Azure Data Factory

The project uses Azure Data Factory to manage and automate the data integration and workflow processes. It extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from different sources and stores the data in Data Lake. Then, Azure Databricks is used for data processing and transformation tasks. Databricks enables scalable and distributed data processing, allowing for effective data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation. It also offers a collaborative environment for data engineers and data scientists to work together smoothly.

Azure Synapse Analytics, a powerful analytics service, is used for data warehousing and advanced analytics. It enables the storage and analysis of large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
